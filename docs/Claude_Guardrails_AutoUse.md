# HTML Mockup Guardrails (Deprecated)

This document has been replaced by the canonical guardrails in `enhanced_pbi_mockup_guardrails.md` at the repository root.

For the latest rules and checklists, open `enhanced_pbi_mockup_guardrails.md`.
The MCP tool "HTML: Guardrails" now reads from that file exclusively.
