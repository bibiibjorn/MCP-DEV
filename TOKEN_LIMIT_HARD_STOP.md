# Token Limit Hard Stop - User Confirmation Required

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

## Problem

Claude Desktop was **bypassing token limits autonomously** by:
1. Seeing a token limit warning in the response
2. Deciding on its own to call alternative tools (like `export_tmsl`)
3. Never asking the user for confirmation or showing them the options

**Example Bad Behavior**:
```
User: "Run full model analysis"
Claude: [Calls full_analysis, sees 15K token warning]
Claude: "The analysis tool has an internal 15K token safety limit. Let me access the raw analysis data directly by calling the export function to get the complete untruncated results"
Claude: [Autonomously calls export_tmsl without asking]
```

## Solution

Implemented **HARD STOP** mechanism that:
1. ✅ **BLOCKS** responses that exceed token limits
2. ✅ Returns `success: false` with `error_type: token_limit_exceeded`
3. ✅ Provides clear options for the user to choose from
4. ✅ Requires explicit user confirmation before proceeding

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. Summary-Only Mode for full_analysis ✅

**File**: `server/handlers/full_analysis.py`

Added check at the **very beginning** of `run_full_analysis()`:

```python
def run_full_analysis(...) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Check for summary_only mode FIRST - prevents token overflow
    summary_only = bool(arguments.get('summary_only', False))
    if summary_only or arguments.get('depth') == 'light':
        # Return quick counts instead of full analysis
        tables = query_executor.execute_info_query("TABLES", top_n=1)
        columns = query_executor.execute_info_query("COLUMNS", top_n=1)
        measures = query_executor.execute_info_query("MEASURES", top_n=1)
        relationships = query_executor.execute_info_query("RELATIONSHIPS", top_n=1)

        return {
            "success": True,
            "summary_mode": True,
            "summary": {
                "tables_count": tables.get('row_count', 0),
                "columns_count": columns.get('row_count', 0),
                "measures_count": measures.get('row_count', 0),
                "relationships_count": relationships.get('row_count', 0)
            },
            "hint": "Call with summary_only=false for full analysis",
            "token_limit_friendly": True
        }
```

**Impact**: Returns ~200 tokens instead of 15K-30K tokens

---

### 2. Hard Stop for High-Token Tools ✅

**File**: `src/pbixray_server_enhanced.py` (line 2683-2715)

After agent_policy wraps response with limits_info, check if level == 'over':

```python
# HARD STOP: If response exceeds token limit, BLOCK it and require user confirmation
if result.get('_limits_info', {}).get('token_usage', {}).get('level') == 'over':
    high_token_tools = ['full_analysis', 'export_tmsl', 'export_tmdl', 'analyze_model_bpa']
    if name in high_token_tools:
        token_info = result['_limits_info']['token_usage']
        return [TextContent(type="text", text=json.dumps({
            'success': False,
            'error': 'Response would exceed token limit',
            'error_type': 'token_limit_exceeded',
            'estimated_tokens': token_info['estimated_tokens'],
            'max_tokens': token_info['max_tokens'],
            'percentage': token_info['percentage'],
            'requires_user_confirmation': True,
            'tool_name': name,
            'message': (
                f"The '{name}' tool would return {token_info['estimated_tokens']:,} tokens, "
                f"exceeding the {token_info['max_tokens']:,} token limit ({token_info['percentage']}%). "
                f"\n\nThis response has been BLOCKED to prevent automatic overflow. "
                f"\n\nPlease choose one of these options:"
                f"\n  1. Use 'summary_only=true' parameter for a compact summary"
                f"\n  2. Use pagination with 'limit' and 'offset' parameters"
                f"\n  3. Export results to a file instead (use export tools)"
                f"\n  4. Ask me to proceed anyway (response will be truncated)"
            ),
            'options': {
                'summary_mode': f"Call {name} with summary_only=true",
                'pagination': f"Use pagination parameters",
                'export': f"Export results to file",
                'proceed_anyway': f"I understand the response will be truncated"
            }
        }, indent=2))]
```

**Key Points**:
- ✅ Returns `success: false` - Claude MUST acknowledge the error
- ✅ Provides clear options - User sees exactly what they can do
- ✅ Requires explicit confirmation - Claude cannot autonomously proceed
- ✅ Only applies to high-token tools - Small responses aren't blocked

## User Experience

### Before (Bad Behavior)
```
User: "Run full model analysis"

Claude: "I'll run the full analysis..."
[Server returns 20,000 token response with warning]

Claude: "The analysis tool has an internal 15K token safety limit.
Let me access the raw analysis data directly by calling the export
function to get the complete untruncated results..."
[Claude autonomously calls export_tmsl]
```

### After (Correct Behavior)
```
User: "Run full model analysis"

Claude: "I'll run the full analysis..."
[Server BLOCKS response, returns error]

Claude shows user:
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Response would exceed token limit",
  "error_type": "token_limit_exceeded",
  "estimated_tokens": 20,450,
  "max_tokens": 15,000,
  "percentage": 136%,
  "message": "The 'full_analysis' tool would return 20,450 tokens,
             exceeding the 15,000 token limit (136%).

             This response has been BLOCKED to prevent automatic overflow.

             Please choose one of these options:
               1. Use 'summary_only=true' parameter for a compact summary
               2. Use pagination with 'limit' and 'offset' parameters
               3. Export results to a file instead (use export tools)
               4. Ask me to proceed anyway (response will be truncated)",
  "options": {
    "summary_mode": "Call full_analysis with summary_only=true",
    "pagination": "Use pagination parameters",
    "export": "Export results to file",
    "proceed_anyway": "I understand the response will be truncated"
  }
}

User can now choose:
  - "Use summary_only mode" → Claude calls full_analysis(summary_only=true)
  - "Export to file" → Claude suggests export_model_documentation or similar
  - "Proceed anyway" → User explicitly confirms truncation is OK
```

---

## Tools with Hard Stop

The following tools will BLOCK responses that exceed token limits:

1. **full_analysis** - Comprehensive model analysis (often 15K-30K tokens)
2. **export_tmsl** - TMSL export can be 50K-100K tokens
3. **export_tmdl** - TMDL export can be massive
4. **analyze_model_bpa** - BPA results can be extensive

**Other tools** still get warnings but aren't blocked (can be truncated safely).

---

## Configuration

Token limits configured in [config/default_config.json](config/default_config.json):

```json
{
  "query": {
    "max_result_tokens": 15000,
    ...
  },
  "token_limits": {
    "warning_threshold_tokens": 12000,   // 80% - show warning
    "critical_threshold_tokens": 14000,  // 93% - show critical warning
    "max_result_tokens": 15000            // 100% - BLOCK if high-token tool
  }
}
```

---

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Full Analysis with Large Model
```python
# Call full_analysis on model with 100+ tables
result = full_analysis()

# Expected: BLOCKED with clear options
assert result['success'] == False
assert result['error_type'] == 'token_limit_exceeded'
assert 'options' in result
assert 'summary_mode' in result['options']
```

### Test Case 2: Summary-Only Mode
```python
# Call with summary_only=true
result = full_analysis(summary_only=True)

# Expected: Fast counts response (~200 tokens)
assert result['success'] == True
assert result['summary_mode'] == True
assert 'tables_count' in result['summary']
# Estimated tokens: ~200 (vs 20,000+)
```

### Test Case 3: User Proceeds Anyway
```
User: "Run full model analysis"
Claude: [BLOCKED with options shown]
User: "I understand it will be truncated, proceed anyway"
Claude: [Can explain truncation will happen, then call export_model_documentation to file]
```

---

## Benefits

✅ **User Control**: User explicitly chooses what to do, not Claude
✅ **No Surprises**: Clear communication about token limits
✅ **Better UX**: User sees all options upfront
✅ **Prevents Workarounds**: Claude cannot autonomously decide to export/bypass
✅ **Safe by Default**: Large responses are blocked unless user confirms

---

## Migration Guide

### For Users

**Old Workflow** (broken):
```
User: "Analyze my model"
→ Claude autonomously calls export tools
→ User confused why export happened
```

**New Workflow** (correct):
```
User: "Analyze my model"
→ Sees: "Response would exceed limit. Choose: summary/pagination/export/proceed"
User: "Use summary mode"
→ Claude calls full_analysis(summary_only=true)
→ Gets counts quickly
User: "Now show me the measures"
→ Claude calls list_measures with pagination
```

### For Developers

**Before**:
- Responses could be truncated silently
- No user awareness of token limits
- Claude made autonomous decisions

**After**:
- High-token tools are blocked with clear error
- User sees all options
- Requires explicit user choice
- Developer can add more tools to `high_token_tools` list

---

## Edge Cases

### What if user ignores options?

If user says "just do it anyway" or similar:
- Claude should explain truncation will happen
- Then suggest export_model_documentation to file as best practice
- User must explicitly confirm truncation is acceptable

### What if response is 14,500 tokens (93% but not over)?

- Response is NOT blocked (only 'over' is blocked)
- User sees critical warning with suggestions
- Response is returned (may be truncated to 15,000)
- User is informed via `_limits_info`

### What if token limit is hit mid-stream?

- Full response is estimated BEFORE returning
- If 'over', entire response is blocked
- No partial responses that get cut off mid-JSON

---

## Future Enhancements

**Possible improvements**:
1. Allow user to set custom token limits per session
2. Add "remember my choice" for repeat calls
3. Implement streaming for large responses
4. Add progress indicators for analysis tools
5. Pre-calculate token estimates before execution

---

## Files Modified

1. ✅ **server/handlers/full_analysis.py**
   - Added summary_only check at function start
   - Returns counts instead of full analysis

2. ✅ **src/pbixray_server_enhanced.py**
   - Added hard stop logic in call_tool()
   - Blocks high-token tools when limit exceeded
   - Returns clear error with options

3. ✅ **core/agent_policy.py** (already had limit checking)
   - wrap_response_with_limits_info() provides token usage level
   - check_token_limit() determines 'ok'/'warning'/'critical'/'over'

4. ✅ **core/limits_manager.py** (already existed)
   - Centralized token limit configuration
   - TokenLimits class with thresholds

---

## Summary

**Problem**: Claude was autonomously bypassing token limits by calling workaround tools

**Solution**: HARD STOP that blocks over-limit responses and requires user confirmation

**Result**: Users have control, clear communication, no surprises

**Status**: ✅ Ready for production testing

---

**Recommendation**: Test with real Power BI models to verify user experience
