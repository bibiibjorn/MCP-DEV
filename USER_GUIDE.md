## Common Issues

### "Python not found"

**Solution:** Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- ‚úÖ Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
- Restart PowerShell after installing

### "Execution policy error"

**Solution:** Run this once in PowerShell (as admin):

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

### "No Power BI instances detected"

**Solution:**
- Make sure Power BI Desktop is actually open with a file loaded
- Wait 10-15 seconds after opening the file
- Check the status bar shows "Ready" not "Loading..."

### AI client doesn't see the server

**Solution:**
- Verify the setup script said "SUCCESS"
- Make sure you fully restarted the AI client (not just minimize)
- Check Task Manager and kill any lingering processes

## Manual Installation (If Script Fails)

If the automated script doesn't work, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for detailed manual steps.

**Key requirement:** The configuration MUST use **full absolute paths** with **double backslashes** (`\\`):

```json
{
  "command": "C:\\Tools\\MCP-PowerBi-Finvision\\venv\\Scripts\\python.exe",
  "args": ["C:\\Tools\\MCP-PowerBi-Finvision\\src\\pbixray_server_enhanced.py"]
}
```

Never use relative paths like `./venv/...` - they won't work!

---

## What to Ask Your AI

Once connected, try these:

```text
"Search for measures containing CALCULATE"
"Analyze this DAX: SUM(Sales[Amount])"
"Export a compact schema"
"Find unused objects in the model"
"Show me rate limit statistics"
"Generate documentation"
```

See [README.md](README.md) for full feature list.

---

## Updating

To update to a new version:

1. Backup your current folder
2. Extract the new version to the same location (overwrite)
3. Run the setup script again:

   ```powershell
   .\setup.ps1
   ```

---

## Uninstalling

1. **Remove from AI client:**
   - Claude: Edit `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` and delete the MCP-PowerBi-Finvision entry
   - ChatGPT: Settings ‚Üí Tools ‚Üí Developer ‚Üí Remove the tool

2. **Delete the folder:**
   - Just delete `C:\Tools\MCP-PowerBi-Finvision` (or wherever you installed it)

---

## Why Virtual Environment?

**Q:** Why doesn't the venv come with the download?

**A:** Virtual environments are machine-specific:
- They contain paths specific to YOUR computer
- They're tied to YOUR Python version
- Including them would make the download 200 MB instead of 50 KB
- Creating fresh ensures compatibility

The `setup.ps1` script handles this automatically!
