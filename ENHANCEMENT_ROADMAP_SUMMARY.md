- Typical Power BI models can be reduced by **30-70%** in size
- Faster refresh times and query performance
- Lower cost for Premium capacity

**Effort:** Medium | **Impact:** Very High

---

### 2. ‚ö° **Enhanced Best Practice Analyzer (60+ Rules)**
**What it does:** Validates model against Microsoft's 60+ standard best practice rules

**Why it matters:**
- Currently we only have ~15 rules vs. 60+ industry standard
- Catches critical issues like:
  - Missing date tables
  - Bi-directional relationships (performance killer)
  - Inefficient DAX patterns
  - Security vulnerabilities

**Effort:** Low | **Impact:** Very High

---

### 3. üìä **Data Type & Cardinality Analysis**
**What it does:** Recommends optimal data types and identifies high-cardinality columns

**Why it matters:**
- **Instant wins:** Changing Int64 ‚Üí Int32 can reduce column size by 50%
- DateTime ‚Üí Date saves 33% when time not needed
- High-cardinality columns (>1M unique values) cause performance issues

**Effort:** Medium | **Impact:** High

---

### 4. üîó **Column-Level Lineage**
**What it does:** Traces data flow from source ‚Üí transformations ‚Üí measures ‚Üí visuals

**Why it matters:**
- **Risk mitigation:** "What breaks if I change this column?"
- Compliance and data governance requirements
- Understanding data transformations

**Effort:** High | **Impact:** High

---

### 5. üöÄ **DAX Performance Analysis**
**What it does:** Identifies slow measures and bottlenecks with execution metrics

**Why it matters:**
- Pinpoints which measures are causing slow reports
- Storage Engine vs Formula Engine breakdown
- Optimization recommendations with priority ranking

**Effort:** High | **Impact:** High

---

## Quick Wins (Low Effort, High Value)

### Expand BPA Rules (1 week)
- Add Microsoft's complete rule set
- Immediate model quality improvements
- No infrastructure changes needed

### Relationship Quality Metrics (3 days)
- Detect problematic patterns
- Many-to-many warnings
- Circular dependency detection

### Measure Folder Hierarchy UI (1 week)

- Improves navigation in large models (100+ measures)
- Better organization visualization

### Naming Convention Validation (3 days)
- Customizable rules (e.g., "m " prefix for measures)
- Consistency checking
- Bulk rename suggestions

1. Column-level lineage
2. DAX performance analysis (requires live connection)
3. Impact analysis ("what breaks if...")
4. RLS validation & testing

**Deliverable:** Full impact analysis and security validation

---

### Phase 4: Automation (Future)
**Goal:** CI/CD integration

1. Git integration for change tracking
2. Automated testing framework
3. Model diff & comparison
4. Breaking change detection

**Deliverable:** DevOps-ready platform

### Future State (After Enhancements)
- **Comprehensive model analysis** competing with Tabular Editor
- **Performance optimization** competing with DAX Studio + VertiPaq Analyzer
- **Impact analysis** competing with Microsoft Purview
- **All-in-one solution** reducing need for 3-4 separate tools

### ROI Estimation
- **Developer Time Savings:** 2-4 hours per model review
- **Model Optimization:** 30-70% size reduction (typical)
- **Performance Gains:** 40-60% faster refresh & query times
- **Cost Reduction:** Lower Premium capacity needs
