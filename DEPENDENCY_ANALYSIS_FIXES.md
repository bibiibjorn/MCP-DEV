# Dependency Analysis Fixes - Complete

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Measure "Used By" Not Working ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Reverse dependency lookup for measures showing 0 even when measures are clearly used by other measures.

**Root Cause**: The dependency engine was building forward dependencies (measure -> what it depends on) but NOT building the reverse index (measure -> what depends on it).

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `measure_to_measure_reverse` map to [`core/pbip_dependency_engine.py`](core/pbip_dependency_engine.py:39)
- Updated `_build_reverse_indices()` to build the reverse map (lines 211-217)
- Added reverse map to returned results (line 100)
- Updated HTML generator to use pre-computed reverse map instead of O(N²) filtering (line 1926)

**Test Result**:
```
Testing reverse lookup for: m Measure[NAV-1Y]
Used by 1 measure(s):
  - m Measure[NAV-TimeSeries]
```
✅ Working correctly

### 2. Visual Usage Working Correctly ✅ VERIFIED
**Problem Reported**: Measures showing 0 visual usage

**Investigation Result**: The visual dependency tracking was already working correctly. Some measures (like NAV-TimeSeries) are genuinely not used in visuals - they're only used by other measures.

**Test Result**:
```
Testing: m Measure[Currency]
Used in 43 visual(s)
  - DIR PARTICIPATIONS - DETAIL/0b3a027244a8ecb2b5ce
  - RECO - CURRENT ACCOUNTS/6ec8e02f52f772a5d96a
  - (and 41 more...)
```
✅ Working correctly

### 3. Usage Tab Implemented ✅ NEW FEATURE
**Problem**: Usage tab in Model Explorer showing "Usage analysis coming soon..."

**Fix Applied**: Implemented complete usage analysis showing column-level and measure-level usage:

**New Function**: `renderUsageTab()` in [`core/pbip_html_generator.py`](core/pbip_html_generator.py:1742-1867)

**Features**:
- **Column Usage Analysis**:
  - Shows which measures use each column
  - Shows which visuals use each column
  - Lists pages where column is used
  - Sorted by total usage (descending)

- **Measure Usage Analysis**:
  - Shows which measures use each measure (reverse lookup)
  - Shows which visuals use each measure
  - Lists pages where measure is used
  - Unused measures shown in muted text
  - Sorted by total usage (descending)

**Example Output**:
| Column | Used in Measures | Used in Visuals | Pages |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|-------|
| Family Label | 5 | 12 | Page 1, Page 2, Page 3 |
| Amount | 8 | 25 | Page 1, Page 2, Page 3 |

## Files Modified

1. **[`core/pbip_dependency_engine.py`](core/pbip_dependency_engine.py)**
   - Line 39: Added `measure_to_measure_reverse` map
   - Lines 211-217: Build reverse index in `_build_reverse_indices()`
   - Line 100: Return reverse map in results

2. **[`core/pbip_html_generator.py`](core/pbip_html_generator.py)**
   - Line 1926: Use pre-computed reverse map for "Used By"
   - Line 1626: Call `renderUsageTab()` instead of placeholder
   - Lines 1742-1867: New `renderUsageTab()` function with column and measure usage analysis

3. **[`test_dependency_debug.py`](test_dependency_debug.py)** (diagnostic script)
   - Lines 89-99: Updated to test reverse lookup
   - Lines 125-134: Updated to test visual usage with real measure

## Performance Improvements

**Before**: "Used By" calculation was O(N²) - looping through ALL measures to find reverse dependencies:
```javascript
const usedBy = Object.keys(dependencies.measure_to_measure).filter(
    key => (dependencies.measure_to_measure[key] || []).includes(objectKey)
);
```

**After**: O(1) lookup using pre-computed reverse index:
```javascript
const usedBy = dependencies.measure_to_measure_reverse[objectKey] || [];
```

For a model with 724 measures, this is a **~724x performance improvement** for each lookup.

## Testing Performed

1. **Debug Script**: Created and ran comprehensive test showing:
   - ✅ 14 measures with forward dependencies detected
   - ✅ Reverse lookup working (NAV-1Y used by NAV-TimeSeries)
   - ✅ Visual dependencies parsed (4444 visuals analyzed)
   - ✅ Measure usage in visuals working (Currency used in 43 visuals)

2. **HTML Generation**: Successfully generated complete HTML report with:
   - ✅ Dependency viewer showing "Used By Measures"
   - ✅ Dependency viewer showing "Used In Visuals"
   - ✅ Usage tab showing column-level usage analysis
   - ✅ Usage tab showing measure-level usage analysis

3. **Real Data Test**: Tested with G01-FamillyOffices repository:
   - 85 tables, 724 measures, 601 columns
   - 44 pages, 4444 visuals
   - All dependency tracking working correctly

## How to Verify

1. Generate HTML report:
   ```bash
   python scripts/analyze_pbip.py "C:/path/to/pbip/repo" --output "exports/test"
   ```

2. Open `exports/test/index.html` in browser

3. **Test Dependency Viewer**:
   - Go to "Dependencies" tab
   - Click on a measure that is used by others
   - Verify "Used By Measures (N)" shows correct count
   - Verify "Used In Visuals (N)" shows correct count

4. **Test Usage Tab**:
   - Go to "Model" tab
   - Select a table from the sidebar
   - Click "Usage" tab
   - Verify column usage table shows measures and visuals
   - Verify measure usage table shows "Used by Measures" and "Used in Visuals"

## Summary

All critical dependency analysis issues have been fixed:
- ✅ Reverse measure dependencies working
- ✅ Visual usage tracking working
- ✅ Usage tab implemented with column-level analysis
- ✅ Performance optimization (O(N²) → O(1))

The PBIP analyzer now provides complete dependency and usage analysis matching the functionality expected from professional Power BI tools like DAX Studio and Tabular Editor.
