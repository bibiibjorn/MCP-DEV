---

### 7. Model Validation (2 tools)

#### `validate_model_integrity`
- Comprehensive validation checks:
  - Orphaned records in fact tables

- Shows DAX filter expressions
- Member counts
- **Usage:** `"Show all RLS roles"`

#### `test_role_filter`
- Tests RLS by executing queries with role context

- **Usage:** `"Test Sales_Manager role with this query"`

#### `validate_rls_coverage`
- Checks which tables have RLS applied
- Security audit and compliance
- Identifies gaps in security
- **Usage:** `"Are all tables protected by RLS?"`
