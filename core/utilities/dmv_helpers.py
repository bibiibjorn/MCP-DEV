    """
    Extract field value from DMV query result row.

    Tries keys with and without bracket notation ([]).
    DMV results may return fields as "Name" or "[Name]" depending on the query,
    so this helper tries both variations.

    Args:
        row: Dictionary containing DMV query result row
        keys: List of field names to try (without brackets)

    Returns:
        First non-empty value found, or None if all keys return empty/None

    Example:
        >>> row = {"[TableName]": "Sales", "Name": "Customer"}
        >>> get_field_value(row, ["TableName", "Table"])
        "Sales"
